 * Interface to a reference-copy ("ghost") of a Part.

 * events. Instead, Ghosts are internally linked to the origial Part from which
 * they have been created. They represent the original Part transparently, but
 * are not editable themselves. All changed applied to the original Part will
 * immediately take effect on Ghosts also.
 *
 * (Currently only implemented for MidiParts.)
