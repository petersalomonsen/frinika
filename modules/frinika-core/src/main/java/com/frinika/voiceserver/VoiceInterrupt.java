/**
 * The voice interrupt is used to alter voice parameters in real time. The
 * reason for why the parameters should be altered through a voice interrupt, is
 * because of latency compensation. An example of this is if you alter the
 * parameters directly - let's say you trigger a release - the sound would end
 * too early. If you modify the parameter through a voice interrupt you're sure
 * that the note will be released exactly when it's supposed to be. The voice
 * server is aware of all scheduled interrupts, and will therefore make sure
 * that it is executed at the right time.
 *
 * How to use? Use this class in your synth on all places where you perform a
 * control change, note off, pitch bend - or other latency sensitive events.
 * Instead of placing the parameter-altering code directly under the method
 * receiving the events, rather create a voiceinterrupt class and place the code
 * under the doInterrupt() method. Then this code will be executed when it's
 * supposed to be.
