<p>This package provides a small framework for plugin services.</p>

<p>ServiceProvider comprises one or more ServiceDescriptors which each describe an individual service.</p>

<p>An abstract ServiceVisitor is provided to visit ServiceProviders and ServiceDescriptors. ServicePrinter is a concrete ServiceVisitor which prints details of the available ServiceProviders and ServiceDescriptors.</p>

<p>Services encapsulates the java version dependency, prior to being exposed as java.util.ServiceLoader in JSE 6 the functionality was only available as com.sun.Service.</p>

<p>Note that generic methods are unfortunately not displayed in the UML class diagram, hence Services appears empty, which it is not. Also, generic links are not displayed, so ServiceProvider and ServiceDescriptor do not appear to be associated, which they are. Still, better than no UML I suppose.</p>
