Release after next ?

PJS / PJL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- Merge drums into single part recording midi?
- Overall master volume slider for Soft synths
- Zoom should keep timeCursor on screen.
- paste into another project.   (copy paste parts now working)
- autosize for parts  (e.g. when pasting into).
- Replace ticks with samples as the finest time resolution. 
- Part start/end adjust on pianoroll.

Sequencer/Notation
------------------
* Support for Key Signature
  (both Time and Key signatures are stored in Midi Files)
   so I plan to is MetaMessages for them (just like Tempo)
* Add support for addding/edit tempo effects. (We need to discuss this)
* Add simple notation printing
* Add more notation features
* Add raw event view/editor
* Add edit fields for 
  the controllers: Reverb,Chorus,Volume,Pan... 
  into (partview) Lane properties,

Audio
-----
* Add support for insert effect on audio and midi parts using rasmusdsp
  - e.g. you click on midi/audio and select edit/add insert effect
  (insert effect could do non realtime-effects like: 
     resample/pitch shifting and stretching)
* Create more user friendly rasmusdsp script editor
  more graphical   (I like the scripting PJL)
* Create simple wave editor editing audio parts
* Create RasmusDSP toot plugins (transformer and analyzer)
  and also create simple and more user friendly
  Reverb,FFT Reverb(FFT Convolution),DeHiss,DeReverb,Disortion,
  Pitch Shifter.
  which uses RasmusDSP behind the scenes.
* Add support for VST instrument and effects
  (KH: I am currently experimenting with JaVaSTyle for that support)
* Frinika audio synthesis on mac os x
* 24 bit recording
* Save audio in serialized form (like the synths)



Misc
----
* Sondfont/Midi/Audio/Project Open/Save Dialog should remember last selected directory used.

[ these are done ?  --------------------------------------------------------
* Make possible to cancel frinika on startup dialog by added X button there
* Move all settings inside "Settings" menu into a new settings dialog
  and stop asking for selectin audio device on startup
  instead add "Set settings" on startup dialog if user want to change and settings
  before running frinika.
  Some settings can not be done once frinika has started without a restart. (e.g. switch audio server)
  The initial input dialog could have a set up option to do this. 
  If you do not hot this then you get the previous settings.  
  
* When frinika is runned for first time or new version was installed then
  we should display the new settings dialog (see above I sometimes use diffferent setups for record playback etc)
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
* The settings dialog should include all settings in tabs
  and that should include for example: Midi In, Audio Out devices and more....
  
  (PJL:  I think only setting that can be done after audio server is started)
  
* When you save your song under different name then 
  the project window title should also change. (PJL: it use to  in the old days!)
* Remove channel 10 limitation for drum patches ?
