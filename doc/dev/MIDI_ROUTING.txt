The project.getMidiDeviceRouter() can be used to redirect midi events.
The implementation is is still evolving.
Possibly the MonitorReceiver could be rewritten using new scheme?


MidiInDeviceManager  (switches to current project)  fowards messages using -->

   ProjectContainer.processMidiMessageFromDevice(device,message,stamp){
        if (midiDeviceRouter.consume(device,message,stamp)) return;
        sequencer.getReceiver().send(arg0, arg1);
   }
