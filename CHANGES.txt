2007-03-17 Version 0.4.0 beta1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Master panel replaced with Toot Mixer
- Added small monitor meters in audio lane headers.
- Increased maximum lanes in the partview to about 50
- Implemented import of multiple audio files.
- Right click menu for parts implemented.
- Separated Audio tracks from softsynths in toot mixer
- Separated Mixer MidiDevices as separate Toot Mixer strips (RasmusDSP)
- Added show button to MidiDeviceMixerPanel  (RasmusDSP)
- Updated rasmusdsp.jar (0.2-build 10 feb 2007)
- com.frinika.project.MidiDeviceDescriptorClass annotation added so that custom soft synths could provide Frinika project save/reload by implementing a custom MidiDeviceDescriptor
- Added support for MidiDeviceDescriptor
- RasmusSynthesizer can be serialized and support for it has been added to MidiDeviceDescriptor (RasmusDSP)
- Added setSaveReferencedData method to SynthWrapper which can be used in serialized soft synths. (RasmusDSP)
- TootVoiceServer for plugging voiceserver based synths into a Toot mixer slot
- "Ghost" parts: Parts that are a transparent, immutable copies of other parts (also called 
  "reference-copy" or "link" sometimes). MidiPartGhosts always refer to exactly one original MidiPart. 
  They can be placed anywhere in a MidiLane and will represent all the events of the original MidiPart 
  at that position. If the original MidiPart changes, every ghost created from that part will also 
  change.
- System exclusive midi data: When hitting Ctrl-ALT-S in the tracker's note-column, an event labeled 
  "SYX" will be inserted and the user is prompted to enter a string of system exclusive data. To make 
  this more comfortable, not only any raw hex-string can be entered, but there are also "SysexMacros" 
  which can be added to package com.frinika.sequencer.midi.sysex. Such a SysexMacro allows e.g. 
  specifying strings of the form "e70fx <reverb-number> <reverb-intensity> <chorus-number> 
  <chorus-intensity>" as value for the SYX-event, and will internally generate the corresponding 
  sequence of system-exclusive data.
- Text lanes: a type of Lane which allows writing text inside the PartView. With this it becomes 
  possible to write lyrics together with composing music, without having to use an external text 
  editor. Each TextPart is in-place editable, i.e. a double-click on it lets you edit the text right 
  inside the PartView.
- Non-destructive changes to midi notes while playing: velocity compression/expansion, velocity 
  offset, transposition, time-shifting of the whole lane by n ticks
- "Looped-mode" of a MidiLane: after the end of the track, keep on repeating the last n ticks (e.g. 
  4 bars) continuously. This feature is a compromise between a track-based sequencer approach (like 
  Frinika), and at least some loop-oriented capability (in the most extreme case, you can use each 
  track in looped mode and can create live-performances by subsequently switching on/off individual 
  tracks)
- Step Recording
- Some tool functions in the menus (ordinary swiss-knife tools that most sequencers have):
  "Repeat" (when repeating MidiParts, the repetitions may be created as "Ghosts", see above)
  "Quantize" (optionally 'loose' quantization, e.g. by 50%)
  "Transpose"
  "Shift"
  "Duration"
  "Time-Stretch"
  "Reverse"
  "Insert Controllers" (allows for automatically inserting a series of controller-values, e.g. a 
  sine-curve, sawtooth, square etc.)
- Minor changes to the "choose controller type" button in the pianoroll (it was not visible under 
  Linux since version 0.3.0), plus the ability to set the right marker of the loop-range with 
  Ctrl-Shift-click (Alt-click didn't work for me on Linux).
- and a simple "System Info" tab added to the AboutPanel.
- Metronome now attach to Toot mixer output
- JackAudioServer now skip processing if AudioProcess is to slow (prevents system hang)
- Frinika scripting using Rhino javascript engine
- Audio recording direct to disk (please report any problems).
